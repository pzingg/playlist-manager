Playlist Manager
================

Manipulate music libraries:

1. Rename music files to conform to 7-bit ASCII, with maximum string length.
2. Update .m3u playlist files to 7-bit ASCII
3. Produce playlist control files for other systems
4. Export playlists and source files to local folder
5. Sync exported files to remote production server

Future wishlist:

6. Batch apply standard audio normalization and/or compression to music files
7. Batch apply ID3 metadata from online service
8. Create persistent song ID and version and store in ID3
9. Drag and drop playlist management with audio player
10. SQL- and JSON-based playlist system
